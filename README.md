### The mobile app for the activists of the 21st century
An cross-platform mobile app to help activists organize safely and efficiently. The main feature is a live updating map with a Waze-esque method of alerting local activists to points of interest and hazards. This will allow organizers to communicate the location of a police blockade to everyone at a rally within seconds, for street medics to keep participants updated with the location of first aid stations, or to help people navigate to the water fountains and public bathrooms at large events. The developers are focused on protecting the safety of activists without allowing the app to be co-opted by police or others with malicious intent. We are open to feedback from both the activist and developer communities.

## Built With
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). Documentation for Create React Native App is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

## Development
For development, you can run the app on your phone using the Expo app or on your computer using an Android or iOS simulator. First, clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
You should see a QR code in your terminal. To run the app on your phone, download the Expo app and scan the QR code. Make sure you are connected to the same network on your phone and the computer running the app. Any changes you make in the code will be reflected in the expo app. If you want to run the app on your computer, type `a` to run an Android simulator or `i` to run iOS. To do so, you must have Android Studio or XCode, respectively.

## TODO
- User should be able to drop a pin on the map
- Login/authentication screens
- Comment & document
- Event privacy settings
- Users can join an event as an organizer, flag holder or participant
- Forum/notifications
- Re-design and beautify UI
- Eject to Android Studio and XCode
